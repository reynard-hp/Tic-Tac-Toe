# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Python

### Assumptions:
* the computer should play the game using 'X's;
* the user should play the game using 'O's;
* the first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
* all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)
* the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
* the program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
* the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
* don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.
